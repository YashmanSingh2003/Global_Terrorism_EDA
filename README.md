# Global_Terrorism_EDA

My project focuses on analyzing global terrorism trends using extensive data analysis techniques. By examining attack patterns across regions and over time, I aim to uncover insights into the dynamics of terrorism worldwide. The analysis highlights regional hotspots, prevalent attack methods like explosives and firearms, and the impact on different sectors such as civilian populations and government institutions. Through this research, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of terrorism's complexities and support efforts towards global security and stability.
